## Feature Data Cache

It is not relieable to push feature data to our repository.
They are big and not trustworthy, because the algorithm may always change.
In fact, all feature data has to be always to be recompute, after something has been merged to master.

TODO: Maybe something for a unit tester, to create multiple feature data after a merge?

So please do not force push feature data to the repository.
